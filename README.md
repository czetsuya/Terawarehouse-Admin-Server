# How to Monitor, Audit and Gather Metrics on a Spring Boot Application

When dealing with a multi-component application such as in a microservice architecture it is very important to manage, audit, gather metrics, health check-up and monitor the different microservice applications or in our example Spring boot applications. With Spring boot framework there is a library that is easily accessible and configured to provide such production-ready features which is the Spring Boot Actuator. These features are accessible via JMX or Http endpoints.

In addition, there is also a community project which is known as Spring Admin that provides an administration that provides a centralized place to access the details submitted by all the registered clients.
